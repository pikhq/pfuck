To build, just type "make". This will create the following files:
pfuck.0.c
pfuck.0.b
pfuck.0
pfuck.-1.c
pfuck.-1.b
pfuck.-1

The .0 versions assume that, on end of file, the current cell will be
set to 0. The output code from them fulfills this assumption. The .-1
versions assume that EOF=-1.

Both versions work in environments where EOF doesn't change the
current cell.

To test the pfuck build, type "make test". This tests the produced
binaries, not the Brainfuck code, by running LostKng.b through them,
and comparing to a known good compilation.
